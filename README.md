About the project
------------------
This was an entry for the  [Windsor Hackforge Summer Games](http://hackf.org/2013-hackforge-summer-games-rules-and-entry-form/).. I had two weeks to complete a game prototype during my free time, this game was the result. This code is in progress and is just a rapid prototype to satisfy the competition deadline. It currently contains about 30 hours of work. You can read a bit into my process on a blog I wrote during the duration: [Pushing Pixels Blog](http://jhive.wordpress.com/).

How to play
------------
The game is played by two players over a network connection. It's developed in javascript using EaselJS to simplify rendering to the canvas. I use Node and Socket.io to facilitate the network play.

Check out the demo at:  [http://rocky-ocean-4629.herokuapp.com](http://rocky-ocean-4629.herokuapp.com). You're going to need a friend to play. Or, alternatively, you can see the game running by refreshing your browser after you create a room (you'll see server status messages near the top of the browser).
